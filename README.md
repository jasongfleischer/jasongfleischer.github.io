This repo is a fork of [the al-folio theme](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio).  Many thanks for the great theme!

Originally, **al-folio** was based on the [\*folio theme](https://github.com/bogoli/-folio) (published by [Lia Bogoev](http://liabogoev.com) and under the MIT license).
Since then, it got a full re-write of the styles and many additional cool features.
