We have received two grants from UCSD this year! Big thanks to the generous support of the Dean of Undergraduate Education John Moore and the CDIIP program for funding "Equity-based project group management tool integrating Canvas and Github". And a huge, heart-felt thank you to Associate Dean Amanda Datnow and the Division of Social Sciences program Advancing Racial Justice for funding "Analysis of racial disparities in criminal charges, convictions, and sentencing within San Diego County"!
