## teaching
My goal is to facilitate students developing a
passion for learning, and the skills to support it.
If you have
questions or need mentorship I'm here to help.
[You can email me](mailto:jfleischer@ucsd.edu) or [schedule an appoint in my office hours](https://calendar.app.google/gxAz1iMJJb2iLkqq8).



## research
I use machine learning and statistical modeling to extract knowledge from complex datasets where it is difficult to directly measure the process of interest. Working in close conversation with domain experts and literature, I make computational models that provide insights and new ways to interpret experimental data. I apply this approach to (1) study the neural processes underlying episodic memory, working memory, and consciousness; (2) analyze relationships between human health, behavior, aging, and various biomarkers; and (3) investigate racial disparities in policing and the justice system.

For more information take a look at [publications](publications/)
and [projects](projects/).


## semi-random things about me
I'm a dad to two kids; one is chest high to me, and I'm only shoulder
high to the other.  The water fountains in my small town Colorado high school were usually plugged
with chewing tobacco and I can saddle a horse.  My first computer's OS was CP/M.  I think detective
fiction is really about philosophy and the search for truth. I play
soccer, if you need an aging full back or midfield destroyer hit me up. My
academic career has been everything except straightforward, if you
need career advice or an ear hit me up.
I've squashed horse cadaver legs in a materials testing machine for
science. I've been mugged. Frankly, I preferred the latter.
