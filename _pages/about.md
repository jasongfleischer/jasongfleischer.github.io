## teaching
My goal is to facilitate students developing a
passion for learning, and the skills to support it. You and I are both
learning how to learn in these strange and difficult
times. I'm grateful for your patience, but also your feedback about
what isn't working.  If you have
questions or need mentorship I'm
[here to help](mailto:jfleischer@ucsd.edu).

See  [teaching](teaching/) for current course information,
and [pandemic](pandemic/) for relevant resources.

Are you a student in one of my classes, and need to talk one on one? [Schedule a visit to my office hours here.](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/selfsched?sstoken=UUFzQ2RXR3dOVnZwfGRlZmF1bHR8Nzg4NGE1Yzc1NmM0NGJlNzUyZmNjMzgxNGUzYWQ1NzM)


## research
I use machine learning to extract knowledge from complex biological
datasets. Working in close conversation with domain experts and
literature, I make computational models that provide insights and new
ways to interpret experimental data.  In the past, I did this to
study the neural processes underlying episodic memory, working memory,
and consciousness. More recently I am applying this approach to
analyze relationships between human health, behavior, aging, and
various biomarkers.

For more information take a look at [publications](publications/)
and [projects](projects/).


## semi-random things about me
I'm a dad to two kids; one is waist high to me, and I'm only shoulder
high to the other.  The water fountains in my small town Colorado high school were usually plugged
with chewing tobacco and I can saddle a horse.  My first computer's OS was CP/M.  I think detective
fiction is really about philosophy and the search for truth. I play
soccer, if you need an aging full back or midfield destroyer hit me up. My
academic career has been everything except straightforward, if you
need career advice or an ear hit me up.
I've squashed horse cadaver legs in a materials testing machine for
science. I've been mugged. Frankly, I preferred the latter.
