Don't hesitate to
[contact me](mailto:jfleischer@ucsd.edu) if you have any concerns about the pandemic, UCSD's response to it, or would like to chat about the research and science behind our response.

## Current COVID-19 situation

At this moment (May 2021) UCSD plans to offer in person instruction as normal during Fall 2021 quarter. As I understand it remote versions of the course will also be available for those students who do not wish to attend in person, or who are unable to do so.

## International students

If you are an international student you may have a complicated visa situation to figure out. Fortunately the [International Students and Programs Office](https://ispo.ucsd.edu/) will keep you [up to date on the latest visa situations and advice](https://ispo.ucsd.edu/news/immigration-policy.html).

## Why you should get vaccinated

A bit of humor, and good science communication
