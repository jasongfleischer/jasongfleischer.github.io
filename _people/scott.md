Hi, I'm Scott Yang! I'm researching the underlying differences between episodic and semantic memory using electroencephalogram (EEG) data. I work on a variety of software projects that provide infrastructure for running large data science and machine learning courses. Asides, I'm also a photographer, bowler, and boba connoisseur. You could reach me at [yuy004@ucsd.edu](mailto:yuy004@ucsd.edu).
