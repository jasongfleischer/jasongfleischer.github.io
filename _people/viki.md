Hi, I am Jiayi Zhao. I have been researching the Racial Disparities in Criminal Charges, Convictions, and Sentencing within San Diego County under Dr. Jason Fleischer since my undergrad senior year. I'm currently a graduate student in UCLA MSBA program. You could reach me through my [email](j4zhao@ucsd.edu).
